Install all dependencies with:
```bash
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-declarative qt6-wayland wayland wlr-protocols kwayland cmake gcc pkgconf make
```

## Package Breakdown

### Qt 6 Framework (minimum version 6.5)
- qt6-base          # Provides Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui
- qt6-declarative   # Provides Qt6::Qml, Qt6::Quick
- qt6-wayland       # Provides Qt6::WaylandClient

### Wayland Support
- wayland           # Wayland client libraries (includes wayland-protocols as dependency)
- wlr-protocols     # wlroots protocols (wlr-foreign-toplevel-management)

### KDE Frameworks
- kwayland          # KWaylandClient for Plasma window management

### Build Tools
- cmake             # Build system (minimum version 3.16)
- gcc               # C++ compiler with C++20 support (or 'clang' as alternative)
- pkgconf           # Package config tool for finding libraries
- make              # Build automation (or 'ninja' as alternative)

## Optional Tools
- ninja             # Faster alternative to make (optional but recommended)

## Build Instructions

After installing dependencies:

```bash
# Build the project
./build.sh

# Run editor mode (design your desktop)
./build/canvasdesk

# Run runtime mode (use your desktop)
./build/canvasdesk --runtime
```

## System Requirements

- Linux with Wayland compositor
- C++20 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.16 or newer
- Qt 6.5 or newer

## Notes

- This project requires a Wayland session (not X11)
- KWaylandClient is needed for window management integration with Plasma
- wlr-protocols provides support for wlroots-based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, etc.)
