All in one QLM idea components:
Lockscreen / Screensaver QML
Bluetooth QML
"Quick Launch" - press meta key get a floating modal, like DMENU or ROFI or such for showing apps
Better File Explorer - list or icons view, mini actual file explorer, or just a single folder in list or icons only mode
"SysInfo" - shows GPU speed / usage, Free RAM, upload / download / etc <- each of these can be their own ATOM component also

make a better Panel, with a splitter control when the Editor is open so that docked components can be positioned to specific areas in the panel and set their length, etc.

basically make "Enhanced" components, Enhanced Panel, Enhanced Clock, Enhanced AppLauncher etc.




ATOM Components : a atom component is just the basic, like an icon to show some info, or a label
--
Session Atom(s) - Logout, etc... idea: when a session atom is place din edit mode, use a msgbox to ask what the atom's ROLE is and assign this in the json save, like, the user drops a session atom qml, message box hav 5 buttons, choose it's role, 4 role buttons (Logout, power off, reboot, lock screen
) and the 5th button is "cancel" <- Cancel is not added in to the Atom json meta, but in the json for it, we have "role" : "Power" <- this tells us to assign it the Session Power role and on click, for this role, show a msgbox asking if they want to power off the system, yes/no, and if clicked yes.. power off the system.  same for the "Logout" role, etc.
