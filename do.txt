Just say "I'm back" and I'll run:
  ls -lt /tmp/canvasdesk-session-*.log | head -1
  (then read the most recent log file)

LAST TEST RESULTS:
  ✅ Compositor started successfully (all 3 monitors detected)
  ❌ CRASH: QML loading error - "Cannot assign to non-existent property 'onCompleted'"
  ❌ Session immediately returned to login screen (didn't even get grey background)

CURRENT FIX: Wrong Component.onCompleted syntax
  - Problem: Line 12 had "onCompleted:" instead of "Component.onCompleted:"
  - Modified: src/editor/qml/DesktopMode.qml
    * Changed "onCompleted:" to "Component.onCompleted:" (line 12)
  - Previous fix: Added "import QtQuick.Window" (that one worked!)
  - Rebuilt successfully
  - Note: Common QML syntax errors to watch for!

WHAT TO EXPECT THIS TEST:
  ✓ CanvasDesk should load WITHOUT crashing (QML error fixed)
  ✓ Grey background should appear AND STAY (not flash and crash)
  ✓ Debug output in log showing all 3 screen geometries and positions
  ✓ Default layout should create: Panel with AppLauncher, Taskbar, Clock, SessionManager
  ✓ Window should span all monitors (using Screen.desktopAvailableWidth/Height)
  ✓ Small edit button (✎) should be visible in top-right corner of one monitor
  ❌ Still won't have mouse cursor (DRM driver issue - separate problem)

  WHERE TO LOOK:
  - Check all 3 monitors for the grey background and edit button
  - If UI only shows on one monitor, that's the next thing to fix

NEXT STEPS AFTER THIS TEST:
  - Click edit button to verify panel opens
  - Open apps (alacritty, firefox) to test Taskbar detection
  - Look for [WLR] messages about window detection in log
  - If Taskbar works: session is basically functional!
  - Save layout and test reload

Brad notes:
  CLAUDE!  IT SHOWED UP WITH THE TASKBAR SHOWING THE WINDOWS ITSELF IN THERE! THE EDIT BUTTON, THE SESSION COMPONENT!!!!     ... NOW WE NEED OT MAKE THE MOUSE WORK!  and it was spread out over all three monitors on the upstairs laptop, will test in the morning on the single display laptop!
